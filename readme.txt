Converts the (Quran 1:1) into a link that links to iknowledge.islamicnature.com.

== Description ==

This plugin converts the code ((Quran 1:1) or (Quran 1:1-7)) into a link 
that links to iknowledge.islamicnature.com. The "Q" in Quran is case insensitive 
and you can put a ":" or "." between the surah and verse number. Curly arrows around 
the text is necessary. The corressponding surah and verse code will go to the actual 
verse on iKnowledge where you can listen to it, read the rest of the surah and lots more.
